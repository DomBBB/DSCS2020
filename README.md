## About
The goal of this course is to efficiently teach you how to build simple applications with Python, that can be made available to technical teams as an API as well as non-technical users via a web interface and making these available to the public or small groups of specific users. The idea of the course is not to make you a full-fletch professional in Python, but teach you the most important concepts that you need in 90% of all cases, while highlighting which areas are not covered in detail and providing resources to these. While some previous experience in programming is advantageous, the course is designed for students without any previous programming experience but is high-paced.

This repository is designed for individuals following the lectures. It is fully documented with subfolder readme files and/or comments.

## Grading
Grading is made up out of two parts
* **Programming assignments** taking place in the first half of the semester. The best 4 out of 5 assignments are counted towards the final grade. (50%)
* **A final course project** in which students work in groups to create an application that applied the contents of the course and additional features that are of interest to the individual groups (50%)
