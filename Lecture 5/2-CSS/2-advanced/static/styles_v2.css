/*
There are three ways of selecting a html tag

1. The element selector: selects html elements based on the tag

body {
 font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

li {
 margin-top: 10px;
}


/*
2. The Class Selector: Selects elements with a specific class attribute that is
  set in the tag: e.g.

    <h2 class='product_card_heading'> heading text </h2>

    <div class='website_section'> [...] </div>

  One tag can also have multiple tags

    <div class="gallery landing_page fancy_style"

  Class selectors is generally used for groups of items that not necessarily
  spacially grouped on the page, but which do follow the same styling rules.

  Classes are referenced by stating the class, preceded by a dot

.card {
  display: inline-block;

  padding-right: 20px;
  border: 2px solid green;
}

3. The ID selector: They select a html with a specific id attribute that is set
  in the tag:

    <img id='navigation_bar_icon'>
    <h1 id='landing_page_header'> heading text </h1>

  IDs are generally used for single items on a website and not for groups. To a
  certain degree, this makes them similar to classes, even though the two are
  different.

  IDs are referenced by stating the id, preceded by a hashtag:
