# Lecture 5

This weeks content is mostly about getting some nicer design to websites created
with Flask. When working with flask, the website you're creating will be mostly
be serving to (a) gather inputs or files from users or (b) share results and
outputs. The idea is not that you create apps where >50% of the work lies in
creating the website, nevertheless a beautiful outwards appearance can be very
valuable to make your app useful and attractive to non-technical users


## 1. Forms with files
Last week we covered how to create forms with flask. For data science
applications you will often also want to collect files containing data from
users.


## 2. Basics of CSS
CSS is the language used to style and arrange html files. Often you will want
make small changes to the appearance of your app: change the color of a button,
the arrangement of a header or paragraph. In this part we briefly cover how to
work with CSS. You can also find a detailed overview as well as more information
on specific styling attributes here:

## 3. Bootstrap
You will never want to style your entire Flask app with CSS yourself. Luckily,
you don't have to: Bootstrap is a framework that allows you to easily integrate
design patterns for things like buttons, images files, navigation bars and more
by adding class tags to your html files. This is what I use 90% of the time to
wrap a nice design around a flask app to make it available to non-technical
users in a work environment

You can find out more about Bootstrap and search for code snippets here:

## 4. Working with external templates
Sometimes you will have to make your application look really professional
because its for a large audience or for the use of an important client. One
great way to add professional designs is by adjusting website templates that
you can find for free on the web.
