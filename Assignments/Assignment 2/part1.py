# Working with packages and learning to use th documentation
"""
1. Loading own code as packages

Load the function for generating differences between lists of words, that you
created in assignment 1, from another python scipt.

Create a copy of the file, give it a different name, and place it another
folder. How can you still load the function from that other script? (hint: you
might need to use a built-in package to do this)
"""
# your code


"""
2. Use the built-in package "random" to do the following:
    1. Generate a random number between 0 and 1 using the random() function
    2. Generate a random *integer* between 5 and 10
    3. Create a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and a 100
    4. Describe in brief: What does the function random.seed(17) do? What might you
        use it for? (you might need to do some additional googling)
"""
# your code


"""
3. Write a function that simulates a random game of rock, paper scissors between
    two imaginary players (player 1 and player 2). Your function should include
    the following:
    * A random number between 10 and 100 is generated to determine how many
        rounds are going to be played
    * Use the random package to decide which strategy (i.e. hand to play) each
        player makes in every round, choosing out of the options in the list
        below. Do NOT use subscripts + random numbers. There is a special
        function in the random package to choose an item from a list.
    * Use logical conditions to determine which player wins each round.
    * Print out a final statement stating (a) how many rounds were played (b)
        who won (c) how many round each player won / how draws there were

Remember to test for edge cases. Think about conditions where your programm
might fail.
