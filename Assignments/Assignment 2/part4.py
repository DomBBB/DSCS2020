# APIs

"""
1. Sign up for the open weather api and get your own api key
https://openweathermap.org/appid
https://openweathermap.org/current
"""
# your code


"""
2. Rewrite the code we covered in class for calling the weather API. Turn it
into a function that takes the argument "location" and returns the temperature
in celsius for the location entered.

Test your function with your current location

Note: You can leave your API key in the code or just replace it with a dummy
content before submission. I will be able to test the function by just pasting
in my API key
"""
# your code


"""
3. Rewrite your function so that it takes the input arguments "longitude" and
"latitude". You will have to adjust the API call to make this work. Have a look
at the documentation.
